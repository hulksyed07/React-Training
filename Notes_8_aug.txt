ECMAScript vs Javascript

ECMAScript6 is only understood by IE(Edge),Chrome

Angular is framework but react is not a framework

React is just a library, Thats why we are bringing Redux

Framework is just a set of rules which developer has to follow 

Browser reads html line by line like xml

At each request, only html page is sent in response.

When the bowser reads the script tags then it loads the js and css files

Transpiling: Converting for eg. ES6 code to ES5 code(It is source code to source code converter)

DOM: (Document object Model)An object or an API that is exposed by the browser that allow your scripting languages to change,modify or work with the objects.

document.getElementById

$.get

Virtual DOM: all the later modification that we do with React JS like setElement, then a virtual dom GETS CREATED IN the memory,then the old and virtual DOM is compared and then the chanege takes place on the actual page.

JSX: Javascript Xml

Unidirectionla data flow:

Action -> Dispatcher -> Store -> View--

NodeJs(Ver6 or above),Starter Kit,NPM packages


NOdeJs is like JVM. It is a virtual machine for javascript(It is a software that we need to install)

NodeJS allows your javacript to run outside the browser. It shines in the server segment

Two chrome plugins are required
React Developer Tools
Redux DevTools(Has a very cool feature called timetravel)

StarterKit
npm install
npm start


React is a library that helps us generate views. It follows a pattern known as component based design

develop the application on a  component basis and not per page basis

Carousel is an image slider


		Tree of components:

				App
				 |
		  ________________________________
		  |       |        |              |
		Navbar	List	Carousel	Deals

ECMAScript 6 is officially called ES2015

Now the javascript will keep on updating its version evry year

ES6 Import export
_________________

Javascript Modules
Each js file is a silo(Independent Unit)(Variables not accessible in the other JS file unless you explicitely mention that you want the variable to be accessible in other js file too)(Export it from one module and import it from another module)
modules can be imported and exported
Reusability



Inside REact
-------------

index.js



import React from 'react';

const App = function(){
	return <div></div>;
}

export default App;



React Vs ReactDOM
------------------

React library has now split into two libaries: react and reactDOM

React core library knows how to render & nest compponents

ReactDOM do the work of pushing virtual DOM to actual DOM.





Adding a component to the DOM
------------------------------

import React and ReactDOM

Create component class

Use ReactDOm's render method which accepts two arguments(what to render , where to render)
