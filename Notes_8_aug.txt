ECMAScript vs Javascript

ECMAScript6 is only understood by IE(Edge),Chrome

Angular is framework but react is not a framework

React is just a library, Thats why we are bringing Redux

Framework is just a set of rules which developer has to follow 

Browser reads html line by line like xml

At each request, only html page is sent in response.

When the bowser reads the script tags then it loads the js and css files

Transpiling: Converting for eg. ES6 code to ES5 code(It is source code to source code converter)

DOM: (Document object Model)An object or an API that is exposed by the browser that allow your scripting languages to change,modify or work with the objects.

document.getElementById

$.get

Virtual DOM: all the later modification that we do with React JS like setElement, then a virtual dom GETS CREATED IN the memory,then the old and virtual DOM is compared and then the chanege takes place on the actual page.

JSX: Javascript Xml

Unidirectionla data flow:

Action -> Dispatcher -> Store -> View--

NodeJs(Ver6 or above),Starter Kit,NPM packages


NOdeJs is like JVM. It is a virtual machine for javascript(It is a software that we need to install)

NodeJS allows your javacript to run outside the browser. It shines in the server segment

Two chrome plugins are required
React Developer Tools
Redux DevTools(Has a very cool feature called timetravel)

StarterKit
npm install
npm start


React is a library that helps us generate views. It follows a pattern known as component based design

develop the application on a  component basis and not per page basis

Carousel is an image slider


		Tree of components:

				App

ECMAScript 6 is officially called ES2015

Now the javascript will keep on updating its version evry year

ES6 Import export
_________________

Javascript Modules
Each js file is a silo(Independent Unit)(Variables not accessible in the other JS file unless you explicitely mention that you want the variable to be accessible in other js file too)(Export it from one module and import it from another module)
modules can be imported and exported
Reusability



Inside REact
-------------

index.js



import React from 'react';

const App = function(){
	return <div></div>;
}

export default App;



React Vs ReactDOM
------------------

React library has now split into two libaries: react and reactDOM

React core library knows how to render & nest compponents

ReactDOM do the work of pushing virtual DOM components to actual DOM.





Adding a component to the DOM
------------------------------

import React and ReactDOM

Create component class

Use ReactDOm's render method which accepts two arguments(what to render , where to render)

There are two types of components:

1. Class based components(when more complexity is involved)
2. Functional components

Use ReactDOM's render method which accepts two arguments:

1. instantiated components
2. DOM node where the components should be rendered.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

DOM is actually a javascript api, we have different methods to access that such as document.getElementById

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Handling user Events:(click, mouseover,keypress,etc)


Hindling user event requires two things:
1. event handler
2. passing the event handler to the element we want to monitor for events


-----------------------------------------------------------

STATE:

a plain js object used to recored or react to user events

Each class based component has its own state object

when a component's state changes,it immediately re-renders and also forces all its children to re-render as well.

State can be initialized in the constructor of the component

State can be modified using this.setState(The reason being many are listening to this change so dont update as this.state.term = 'Hello')

PROPS:

are used when the data needs to be passed from the parent to the child component.

we declare a property on the JSX 

This property is availale as this.props



    ----------------------> Initialization -------------------------------->--------------
    |                      1. componentWillMount          				  |
    |                      2. render							  |
    |                      3. componentDidMount					  State Changes
  Unmounting 										  |      1. shouldComponentUpdate
    |  1. componentWillUnmount                                                            |      2. componentWillUpdate
    |                             							  |      3. render
    |										          |      4. componentDidUpdate
    |											  |
    |---<-------------------< Prop Changes <-----------------------------------------------
			    1.componentWillRecieveProps
			    2. shouldComponentUpdate
			    3. componentWillUpdate
			    4. render
			    5. componentDidUpdate





----------------------------------------

To implement css, use className instead of class because we already have a class keyword in JSX used to define component



----------------------------------------------------


React created view pages, redux handles the data part

React inspired by flux



	(Redux takes care of this)					(React takes care of this)
         Data that powers the app                                    Views that display the data
	_________________________                                    ___________________________
	|        Stores          |                                   |       Component1		|
	|        Actions	 |				     |       Component2		|
	|	Reducers	 |				     |___________________________
	--------------------------						|
		   |-------------->------- App-------<--------------------------|



Redux : 3 principles


1. One Immutable Store(Store will be a single object in the entire life cycle)(whole store object will get changed at a time)
2. Action triggers Changes
3. Reducers update state



				Redux Flow

	----->Action       {type:RATE_COURSE, rating:5}
	|	|
	|	|
      Store <---- Reducers     function appReducer(state=defaultState,action){
	|	|    ----->			switch(action.type){
	|	|				    case RATE_COURSE:
	|	|   notified via React-Redux	    //retrun new state
	<--- React				}
					}



--------------------------------------------------------
Immutability

Signature
____________
Object.assign(target, ...sources)


Example
_________

Object.assign({},state,{role: 'admin'})



Reducer is a function that takes state & an action and retruns new state


---------------------------------------------------------------------

Fat arrow function:


function(result){

}


is equivalent to 

result => {

}

in ES6

useful for defining anonymous functions only(not for named function)

---------------------------------------------------------------------


Redux Store:

let store = createStore(reducer)




Two types of components:

1. Container:
	Focus on how things work
	Aware of redux
	Subscribe to redux state
	Dispatch redux actions
	Generated by react-redux library

2. Presentational:
	Focus on how things look
	unaware of redux
	Reads data from props
	invoke callbacks on props
	Written by hand


React-redux
----------------

	Provider 			Connect

Attaches app to store		Creates container components
